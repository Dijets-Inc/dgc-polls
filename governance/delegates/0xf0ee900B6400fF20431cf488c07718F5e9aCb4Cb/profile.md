### Brief Introduction


### DGC Member Statement


### Conflicts of Interest

I confirm that I do not participate in any other organisation's voting process or DAO governance activities that would represent a potential conflict of interest.

### DGC Member Declaration

As Dijets Council Member I will;

 - operate and vote on proposals that I believe will be in the best interest of Dijets and DJTX Holders.
 - professionally and unbiasedly review each proposal prior to the submission of my vote.
 - within reason - be accessible to the community to answer questions and discuss my voting rationale when required.

I have read, understood and signed the [DGC Member's Manifesto](https://dijets.io/manifesto) and agree to carefully abide by the points entailed in it.
