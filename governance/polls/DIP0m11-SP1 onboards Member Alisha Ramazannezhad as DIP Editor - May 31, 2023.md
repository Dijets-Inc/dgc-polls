# Poll: DIP0m11-SP1 onboards Member Alisha Ramazannezhad as DIP Editor - May 31, 2023

Dijets Core Team acting as interim Governance Arbiter have placed an approval poll into Dijets Voting System for the appointment of DGC Member Alisha Ramazannezhad as DIP Editor. The sub-proposal DIP0m11-SP1 is in line with the process module [DIP0m11](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP0#dip0m11-core-personnel-onboarding) of the [DIPs Framework](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP0) for core personnel onboarding. This Governance Poll will be active for seven days beginning on Wednesday, May 31 at 16:00 UTC. Note that the DGC Members do not require a CAP before voting on this approval poll.

Procuring a CAP will be mandatory for DGC members before each governance cycle begins. CAPs and the Governance Cycle will come into effect as soon as the program has had the required core personnel onboarded and it has had some time to mature.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **Members may vote for a single option.**
- **Members should vote for the option they prefer.**
- **Members can choose to 'Abstain' should they not have any preference or if they prefer either options.**

**If the votes for the 'NO' option exceed the votes for the 'YES' option then the following outcomes will occur:**
