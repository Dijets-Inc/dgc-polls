# Poll: Ratification Poll for DIP2 which defines the process for the amendment and removal of an accepted DIP - May 28, 2023

Dijets Core Team acting as interim Governance Arbiter has placed an approval poll in Dijets Voting System for [DIP2](https://dips.dijets.io/dips/details/DIP2). This Governance Poll will be active for eight days beginning on Sunday, May 28 at 16:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **Members may vote for a single option.**
- **Members should vote for the option they prefer.**
- **Members can choose to 'Abstain' should they not have any preference or if they prefer either options.**

## Review

DGC Members may vote in this formalisation poll to express support or opposition to DIP2 being accepted or rejected as a process summary proposal for the amendments and removals of existing DIPs.

A brief summary of this proposal is as follows:

**DIP2 provides a process by which existing accepted DIPs can be amended or removed and replaced with a canonical versioning system. DIP Amendments that preserve the DIP number can be performed to modify any aspect of an existing DIP, including the Genesis DIP (DIP0). There are no restrictions on how an existing DIP can be amended.
DIP2 proposes the ability to amend multiple DIPs submitted as a single subproposal. DIP2 also enables the complete removal of one or more DIPs that are inactive or obsolete. Similar to the amendments process, multiple DIPs may be removed in a single subproposal for removal.**

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option PLUS the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the minimum set voting weight of 10000 HAL tokens, then the proposal will be marked as Accepted:**

**In the event of the proposal not reaching the minimum set voting weight of 10000 HAL tokens or if the votes for the 'No" option exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then the proposal will be marked as rejected.**
