# Approval Poll for onboarding Alisha Ramazannezhad as DIP Editor under sub-proposal (DIP0m11-SP1) - May 24, 2023

Dijets Core Team acting as interim Governance Arbiter have placed an approval poll into Dijets Voting System for the appointment of DIP Editor as described in [DIPs Framework](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dips/blob/master/DIP0/dip0.md#dip0m9-dip-editor-role). This Governance Poll will be active for seven days beginning on Wednesday, May 24 at 16:00 UTC. Note that the DGC Members do not require a CAP position before voting on this approval poll. Procuring a CAP will become a mandatory step to undergo for DGC members before each governance cycle begins. CAPs and the Governance Cycle will come into effect as soon as the program has the required core personnel onboarded and it has had some time to mature.

**This is a binary vote.**
- **Members may vote for a single option.**
- **Members should vote for the option they prefer.**
- **Members can choose to 'Abstain' should they not have any preference or if they prefer either options.**

## Review

Dijets Council may vote in this approval poll to express support or opposition to DIP0m11-SP1 being accepted and implemented in Dijets Governance.

A brief summary of this proposal is as follows:

*DIP0m11-SP1 onboards Alisha Ramazannezhad as DIP Editor to enforce the administrative and editorial aspects of the DIPs process and DIPs framework.*

Please review the links below to inform your position on this proposal before voting.
* [Proposal Repo Link](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dips/blob/master/DIP0/DIP0m11-Subproposals/DIP0m11-SP1.md)
* [Proposal Discussion Thread](https://forum.dijets.io/t/onboarding-dgc-member-alisha-ramazannezhad-as-dip-editor-under-dip0m11-sp1/28)

## Outcomes

## "Accepted" Proposal

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option PLUS the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the minimum set voting weight of 1000 HAL tokens, then the following outcomes will occur:**
* Dijets Governance is currently undergoing the initial setup processes with DIP0m11-SP1 being the very first proposal for core personnel onboarding. In determination of the program's infancy and DIP0m11-SP1 implementation Dijets Core Team will mark the proposal **Accepted** and ensure its passage to the accepted DIPs directory signalling Member Alisha Ramazannezhad as the new DIP Editor. The DIP editor will subsequently become responsible for labelling the proposal/sub-proposal numbers and marking them as accepted or rejected for all future DIPs.
* Work required to implement all future proposals will be relayed by the DIP Editor to the core team.

## "Rejected" Proposal

**In the event of the proposal not reaching the minimum set voting weight of 1000 HAL tokens or if the votes for the 'No" option exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then the proposal will be marked as rejected.**
